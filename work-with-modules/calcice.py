# there we will create our own module for example just will get short pi number

pi = 3.1415

# we also can add some futures like for calc hehe 

def square(x):
    return x ** 2
def cude(x):
    return x ** 3 
def circumference(radius):
    return 2 * pi * radius
def area(radius):
    return pi * radius ** 2

# there we done now we can go to our main file and test it
